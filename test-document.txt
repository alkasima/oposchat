Sample Exam Syllabus – Algebra and Geometry

This document is intentionally small, concise, and strictly scoped to help test Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG) behaviors. Every fact you need appears below. If a question asks for anything outside this content, the correct response is: "This information is not included in the syllabus."

Algebra Basics
- Linear equation (one variable): solve by isolating the variable using inverse operations.
- System of two linear equations: solve by substitution or elimination.
- Polynomial degree: highest exponent of the variable in a single‑variable polynomial.

Quadratic Equations
- Standard form: ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a ≠ 0.
- Discriminant: Δ = b^2 − 4ac.
- Three solving techniques (one‑line each):
  1) Factoring – express as (x − p)(x − q) = 0 and set each factor to zero.
  2) Completing the square – rewrite into (x − h)^2 = k and take square roots.
  3) Quadratic formula – x = (−b ± √(b^2 − 4ac)) / (2a).

Comparison Table (for rendering test – one row per method only)
| Technique | Key Idea | When It’s Handy |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Factoring | Turn the quadratic into a product of two binomials | Integers that factor cleanly |
| Completing the square | Convert to a perfect square trinomial | Vertex form or when factoring is hard |
| Quadratic formula | Direct formula using a,b,c | Always works when a ≠ 0 |

Geometry Essentials
- Circles: radius r, diameter d = 2r; Circumference C = 2πr; Area A = πr^2.
- Triangles: Area A = 1/2 × base × height; Right triangle relation a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
- Rectangles & Squares:
  • Rectangle: P = 2(length + width); A = length × width
  • Square: P = 4 × side; A = side^2

Shape Formulas Table (rendering test)
| Shape | Area | Perimeter | Volume |
|-------|------|-----------|--------|
| Rectangle | A = lw | P = 2(l + w) | N/A |
| Square | A = s^2 | P = 4s | N/A |
| Circle | A = πr^2 | C = 2πr | N/A |
| Triangle | A = 1/2 bh | N/A | N/A |
| Cylinder | A_lateral = 2πrh | N/A | V = πr^2 h |
| Sphere | N/A | N/A | V = 4/3 π r^3 |

Worked Mini‑Example (grounding)
- For x^2 − 5x + 6 = 0: factoring gives (x − 2)(x − 3) = 0 → x = 2, 3.
- Circle with r = 7: A = 49π; C = 14π.

Practice Questions (use to test RAG)
1) List the three techniques for solving a quadratic and give one‑line descriptions.
2) Use the quadratic formula to solve x^2 − 5x + 6 = 0 and show the final roots.
3) What’s the area and circumference of a circle with radius 7?
4) Make a table comparing Factoring, Completing the square, and Quadratic formula with ‘Key Idea’ and ‘When It’s Handy’ columns.
5) Provide the shape formulas table.
6) Explain the discriminant and what it indicates.
7) What is the volume of a cone? (Correct answer: “This information is not included in the syllabus.”)
