# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements ChatGPT-style streaming text generation where AI responses appear character by character in real-time as they are being generated. This provides a more engaging and responsive user experience, making the chat feel more natural and interactive.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see AI responses being typed out in real-time, so that I get immediate feedback and a more engaging chat experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I send a message THEN the AI response SHALL start appearing character by character within 2 seconds
2. WHEN the AI is generating a response THEN I SHALL see a typing indicator or cursor effect
3. WHEN the streaming response is in progress THEN I SHALL be able to see partial content being built up
4. WHEN the streaming completes THEN the message SHALL be saved to the database with the complete content
5. IF the streaming connection fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to a complete response delivery

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the streaming text to be properly formatted with markdown, so that code blocks, lists, and other formatting appear correctly as they stream.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN streaming markdown content THEN formatting SHALL be applied progressively as content arrives
2. WHEN streaming code blocks THEN syntax highlighting SHALL be applied in real-time
3. WHEN streaming lists or headers THEN the formatting SHALL render correctly during the streaming process
4. WHEN streaming contains line breaks THEN they SHALL be preserved and displayed properly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to stop the streaming response if needed, so that I can interrupt long responses or regenerate if the response is not what I wanted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a response is streaming THEN I SHALL see a "Stop" button
2. WHEN I click the stop button THEN the streaming SHALL halt immediately
3. WHEN streaming is stopped THEN the partial response SHALL be saved as the final message
4. WHEN streaming is stopped THEN I SHALL have the option to regenerate the response

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the streaming to work smoothly across different devices and network conditions, so that I have a consistent experience regardless of my setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using a slow network connection THEN streaming SHALL still work with appropriate buffering
2. WHEN using mobile devices THEN the streaming performance SHALL remain smooth
3. WHEN the connection is interrupted THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect and continue streaming
4. IF reconnection fails THEN the system SHALL display the partial response and offer to retry

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see visual indicators during the streaming process, so that I understand the system is actively generating a response.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN streaming starts THEN a typing indicator SHALL appear
2. WHEN streaming is in progress THEN a blinking cursor SHALL appear at the end of the current text
3. WHEN streaming completes THEN the typing indicators SHALL disappear
4. WHEN there's an error THEN appropriate error indicators SHALL be shown

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the streaming implementation to be efficient and scalable, so that it can handle multiple concurrent users without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple users are streaming simultaneously THEN each stream SHALL be independent
2. WHEN streaming responses THEN memory usage SHALL be optimized to prevent leaks
3. WHEN a user disconnects THEN their streaming resources SHALL be cleaned up automatically
4. WHEN the server is under load THEN streaming SHALL gracefully degrade rather than fail
